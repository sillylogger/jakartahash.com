  comment: "Put simply, this group of idiots masquerading as a \"running club\" is actually more of a loosely-organized criminal operation, existing purely for the purpose of enabling a mob of adults who spend their Monday nights living out some kind of juvenile delinquent fantasy of sex, beer, and perverted songs. Dog friendly, good for kids."

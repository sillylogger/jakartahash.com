That's the San Francisco Hash House Harriers, except your mental image should be closer to a raw fish on a plate that was taken out of the water three days ago. Take an extra moment to imagine the smell too.\n\nFirst off, you'll be participating as the whipping boy following a trail that is is really a sadistic competition of over-compensating people with names like Millimeter Peter to see who can find a path that checks off the greatest number of the top 25 steepest streets in San Francisco combined with as many staircases as can be added. Despite billing themselves as a drinking club with a running problem, you'll probably not find a drop until the end of this trip through hell. Also, that homeless looking fellow following you on your first run? Turns out he's one of them too and his name is Raspukin. Go back to imagining the fish smell.\n\nIt's not over yet. Yeah, there's beer at the end but it's chosen by whoever already decided to torture you with the trail, so prepare for further disappointment. Let me paint a picture to help offend another one of your senses: you're listening to a church choir composed of the people who cry when rejected from the first round of American Idol. You couldn't get them to move their vocal chords in unison if you hooked them all up to defibrillators that fired at once. I know this part very well from being forced to try and make it work. Oh, right, the defibrillator part comes from the over 6' tall bearded guy known as The Perfect Woman (to each their own and all that, but really?) who has developed a reputation for plugging some wires into the nearest wall outlet and shocking whoever is nearby. Yup.\n\nSure, the first time's free, but you're better off putting your time and the $6 cover that includes free \"beer\" towards... anything else."

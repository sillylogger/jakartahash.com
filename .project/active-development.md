# Active Development – Hash House Harriers Jakarta

## Current Focus
- Finalize MVP Jekyll scaffold
- Implement Instagram Graph API integration on home page

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fetch IG posts via token and render in JS
- [ ] Build `_data/kennels.yml` to drive kennel listing
- [ ] Add social/meta tags and favicon
- [ ] Test site on both domains

## Temporary Notes
- Avoid `url:` in `_config.yml` to support both domains
- `project-context.md` should not change frequently
- Use `.project/` folder for internal Cline memory files

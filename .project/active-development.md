# Active Development – Hash House Harriers Jakarta

## Current Focus
- Improve the asthetics of the site, potentially leveraging the assets/cartoon-finished.png

## Next Steps
- [ ] Upgrade the https://lightwidget.com/my-widgets to paid once they accept your credit card
- [ ] Add social/meta tags and favicon
- [ ] Test site on both domains

## Done
- [x] Fetch IG posts via Instagram Graph API and render in JS on home page
- ✅ Build `_data/kennels.yml` to drive kennel listing
- ✅ Change the index.md and kennels.md content to be markdown instead of html, but allowing raw html.

## Temporary Notes
- Avoid `url:` in `_config.yml` to support both domains
- `project-context.md` should not change frequently
- Use `.project/` folder for internal Cline memory files

### On On!

The Hash House Harriers (HHH or H3) is a global network of non-competitive running and social clubs. Originating in Kuala Lumpur in 1938, the group combines elements of running, orienteering, and socializing. Participants, known as "hashers," follow trails laid by "hares," navigating various terrains to reach the end point.

Often dubbed "a drinking club with a running problem," the Hash emphasizes camaraderie and fun over competition. Events typically conclude with social gatherings where members share stories, partake in refreshments, and engage in light-hearted traditions.
